TerribleFS is a simple-to-use filesystem, whos metadata consists of a length-prefixed vector of sets of 3 values. TerribleFS, and can not make any reliability or atomicity garuntees. Just don't turn off your computer!

first byte is the number of files in this filesystem
then 255 file entries (even if the first byte isn't 255):
  8 bytes for the ascii file name
  double word (4 bytes) for the file offset, starting from **the beginning of the drive** (then we can make the MBR a writable file...)
  double word (4 bytes) for the file size
then file data...
