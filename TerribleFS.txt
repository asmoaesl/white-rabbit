TerribleFS is a simple-to-use filesystem, whos metadata consists of a constant-length vector of sets of 3 values. TerribleFS is terrible, and therefor can not make any reliability or atomicity garuntees. Just don't turn off your computer!

then 256 file entries (even if the first byte isn't 255):
  8 bytes for the ascii file name (if the first byte is 0x80 or more it has special meaning)
  double word (4 bytes) for the file offset in sectors, starting from **the beginning of the drive** (then we can make the MBR a writable file...)
  double word (4 bytes) for the file size
then file data...

first byte special meanings:
0x80: End of list
0x81: Unused
0x82 - 0xFF: Reserved
